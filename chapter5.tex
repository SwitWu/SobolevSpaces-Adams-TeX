\section{Interpolation on Order of Smoothness}

\begin{para}
  We consider the problem of determining upper bounds for $L^p$ norms of
  derivatives $D^\beta u$, $0<|\beta|<m$, of functions in $W^{m,p}(\Omega)$
  in terms of the $L^p$ norms of $u$ and its partial derivatives of order $m$.
  Such estimates are conveniently expressed in terms of the seminorms $|\cdot|_{j,p}$
  defined in Paragraph~4.29. Theorem~5.2 below provides such an estimate for
  the seminorm $|u|_{j,p}$ in terms of $|u|_{m,p}$ and $\|u\|_p$, as well as
  some elementary consequences of this estimate. Such estimates arose
  in the work of Ehrling [E], Nirenberg [Nr1, Nr2], Gagliardo [Ga1, Ga2],
  and Browder [Br1, Br2], and were frequently proved under the assumption
  that $\Omega$ satisfies the uniform cone condition, at least if $\Omega$
  is unbounded. However, we will prove Theorem~5.2 assuming only the cone
  condition. In fact, even the weak cone condition is sufficient for the proof,
  as is shown in [AF1].

\begin{theorem}
  Let $\Omega$ be a domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfying the cone condition.
  For each $\epsilon_0>0$ there exist finite constants $K$ and $K'$, each
  depending on $n$, $m$, $p$, $\epsilon_0$ and the dimensions of the cone $C$
  providing the cone condition for $\Omega$ such that if $0<\epsilon\leq\epsilon_0$,
  $0\leq j\leq m$, and $u\in W^{m,p}(\Omega)$, then
  \begin{align}
    |u|_{j,p} & \leq K\bigl(\epsilon |u|_{m,p} + \epsilon^{-j/(m-j)}\|u\|_p\bigr), \label{eq:5.1} \\
    \|u\|_{j,p} & \leq K'\bigl(\epsilon\|u\|_{m,p} + \epsilon^{-j/(m-j)}\|u\|_p\bigr), \label{eq:5.2} \\
    \|u\|_{j,p} & \leq 2K' \|u\|_{m,p}^{j/m} \|u\|_p^{(m-j)/m}. \label{eq:5.3}
  \end{align}
