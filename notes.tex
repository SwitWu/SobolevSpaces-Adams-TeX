\chapter*{Notes}

In the process of retyping the original book,
most of the materials are kept unchanged.
However, there are some small modifications listed as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Subset$  are changed into $\subset\subset$.
  \item $\text{bdry}$ are changed into $\partial$.
  \item All the sections headings are numbered.
\end{itemize}

Most of the works are finished with the help of mathpix.
